SMTP MODULE for DRUPAL 5.0
-----

This module adds SMTP functionality to Drupal.

Notes:
Drupal will often use the email address entered into "Administrator>Site configuration>E-mail address"
as the from address. It is important for this to be the correct address and some ISPs will block email
that comes from an invalid address.


This module uses the smtp and mail class's from PHPMailer.
http://phpmailer.sourceforge.net
